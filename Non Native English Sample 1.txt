Nothing in my life would be the same if I had not spent Saturday afternoons translating my favorite songs and pausing & repeating after Hermione in the Harry Potter movies 10 years ago.

As an introverted teenager, I was often urged by my parents to go out more, to open my bedroom door, be less in my own head. I was called a grandma repeatedly during my uni years, when I denied invitations to spend more of the early hours of the day out and about, dancing, drinking, partying, having fun.

But I’ve always had a lot of fun. I’ve always loved learning and languages were my thing. I had fun looking for the most native resources to learn from; I had fun listening to British radio, watching American movies, catching the latest episodes of Spanish TV shows. I had fun learning songs by heart, looking up new words (and impressing my classmates with vocabulary I’d known before the lesson even started, I must admit).

Knowing 2 languages other than my mother tongue has given me opportunities I’d never dreamed of, and the Nelson Mandela quote you can find on this website never rang so true.

Today, every day feels somewhat like to a Saturday afternoon spent in the comfort of my room, learning what makes me the most excited to learn about. I am confident enough with my language skills to work in a language that is not mine, to connect with people who I have almost nothing in common other than our humanness, and I get to make life plans with someone who’s spent almost all his life on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean & opposite hemisphere.
